# All Chapters of the Bible: A Paper Checklist ‚úÖ

Possibly the simplest and most comprehensive Bible reading plan in existence: all 1189 chapters, as check-boxes. ‚úÖ

Simply print off the [PDF](chapters-checklist.pdf), and keep it near wherever you do your Bible reading. When you read a chapter, check the box for the corresponding chapter on the page. When all the boxes have been filled, print another copy! üòÅ

I keep mine on a clipboard near my Bible. You may prefer to fold it and put it right into the pages of your Bible, or to keep it in your journal.

I purposely left this PDF without a title, as I have a few of these sheets going at any given time for each of the languages I know or am studying. I prefer to print off several of these pages at once and hand-label them ‚úçüèΩ, instead of creating a different document for each translation. (I'm currently working through the Bible with this list in English, Greek, Hebrew, and Turkish; so, I have a different sheet for each of those languages, with an appropriate title written in for each. I could also see value in having a different sheet for each _translation_ that someone is reading in a single language, as I know some people who make a regular habit of working through a different translation of the Bible every year or two.)

The current version of this PDF is ordered according to the Protestant canon, but the [LaTeX code](chapters-checklist.tex) is included for if you want to modify it to your needs. I am finding the [ordering differences between the Protestant Old Testament and the Hebrew Tanakh](https://bibleproject.com/explore/video/old-testament-tanak/) to be a bit annoying to navigate when using this list for my Hebrew reading, so I might end up creating another version of this in the future that uses the traditional ordering.
